<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN> Initial remarks</A>
</H1>

<P>
This document is intended for people who are interested in understanding how FORM works internally,
how to find and correct bugs in the source code, and how to extend FORM by implementing new
features.

<P>
It is assumed, that the source code is available, either as a package or directly via CVS access to
the FORM repository. The FORM package contains many files and several subdirectories. The actual
sources of FORM, TFORM, and P<SMALL>AR</SMALL>FORM are all in the directory <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">sources</SPAN> (see section
<A HREF="#sec:source">2</A> for an overview).  Documentation can be found in the directory <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">doc</SPAN>. The testing
suite is contained in the directory <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">check</SPAN>.

<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN> Overview of the source code
</H1>

<P>
Here we will discuss general aspects of the source code, i.e. the files contained in the directory
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">sources</SPAN>.

<P>
FORM is written in ANSI C. The code is split up in header files <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">*.h</SPAN> and source files
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">*.c</SPAN>. Files usually don't come in pairs of a header file with the declarations and a source file
with the definitions, but instead most declarations are collected in a few headers. The declaration
of function headers is done in <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">declare.h</SPAN> for example. The most prominent exceptions are
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">parallel.h</SPAN> and <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">minos.h</SPAN>.

<P>
Each file usually contains many hundred lines of code. To make the files more accessible, the code
is structure by so&ndash;called folds. If you use the editor STedi, the code will be visualized
correctly. If you use a vi&ndash;compatible editor, it is advisable to activate folds and set the
foldmarkers to <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">set foldmarker=#[,#]</SPAN>

<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN> The global structs</A>
</H2>

<P>
FORM keeps its data organized in several global structs. These structs are defined in
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">structs.h</SPAN> (in the fold <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">A</SPAN>) and come by the names <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">M_const</SPAN>, <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">P_const</SPAN>, ....  The
various global variables are grouped in these structs according to their rôle in the
program. The fold commentaries give details on this. <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">M_const</SPAN> is for global settings at startup
and <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">.clear</SPAN>, for example.

<P>
The various structs are collected in the struct <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">AllGlobals</SPAN>. In the case of sequential FORM,
this struct is made into the type <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">ALLGLOBALS</SPAN>, and in <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">inivar.h</SPAN>, the global variable <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">A</SPAN> is
defined having this type. This global variable <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">A</SPAN> holds all the data defined in the various
structs. In <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">variable.h</SPAN> several macros are defined to simplify (and more importantly unify) the
access to the struct elements. For example, one can access the variable <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">S0</SPAN> in <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">T_const</SPAN> as
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">AT.S0</SPAN>.

<P>
With the multi-threaded version TFORM things are a little bit more complicated, because some data
needs to be replicated and made private for each thread. This kind of data is situated in the
structs <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">N_const</SPAN>, <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">R_const</SPAN>, and <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">T_const</SPAN>. For TFORM, these structs are collected in the
struct <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">AllPrivates</SPAN> (which makes up the type <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">ALLPRIVATES</SPAN>), all other structs go into the
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">AllGlobals</SPAN> struct. The global variable <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">A</SPAN> now contains only the non-thread specific data. For
each thread a <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">AllPrivates</SPAN> struct is dynamically allocated and the global pointer variable (in
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">inivar.h</SPAN>) <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">AB</SPAN> holds their references. <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">AB</SPAN> is an array of pointers where the index
corresponds to the thread number. The macros defined in <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">variable.h</SPAN> to access the global struct
data are made such that they transparently work with the <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">AB</SPAN> array. The user doesn't need to care
about these details and can still write as in the previous example <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">AT.S0</SPAN>. This keeps the code
of sequential FORM and multi-threaded TFORM uniform. 

<P>
The only small price one has to pay to make this uniform access by macros possible is to make sure
every function in FORM knows in which thread it is executed. The <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">AN</SPAN>, <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">AR</SPAN>, and <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">AT</SPAN> macros
use a variable <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">B</SPAN>, which is set to the correct entry in <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">AB</SPAN> by one of two ways. First, a
function can use the macro <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">GETIDENTITY</SPAN> (defined in <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">declare.h</SPAN>).  In TFORM&nbsp; it calls
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">WhoAmI()</SPAN> to get the thread number, declares the pointer <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">B</SPAN>, and sets <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">B</SPAN> to point to the
correct entry in <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">AB</SPAN>. In sequential FORM this macro is empty. The second way is to get the
variable <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">B</SPAN> as a parameter from the caller. For this method the macros <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">PHEAD</SPAN>, <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">PHEAD0</SPAN>,
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">BHEAD</SPAN>, and <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">BHEAD0</SPAN> exist (defined in <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">ftypes.h</SPAN>), which can be used in the parameter list of
the function declarations. The variants with a zero differ only by not including a trailing comma,
which is not allowed if no other parameters are following in the declaration. Usually, <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">PHEAD</SPAN> is
used in the declaration (it includes type information), while <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">BHEAD</SPAN> appears in the calling of
functions. Which way to set <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">B</SPAN> is chosen, depends on the use of the function. The <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">PHEAD</SPAN> method
is faster than <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">GETIDENTITY</SPAN> and should be preferred in functions that are called very often. On
the other hand, <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">GETIDENTITY</SPAN> is more general as it does not rely on every caller to supply <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">B</SPAN>. 

<P>
The elements of the structs are of various types. Some types are just simple macros mapping directly
to built-in types (see <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">form3.h</SPAN>) like <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">WORD</SPAN>, others are names for structs that are defined
(mostly) in <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">structs.h</SPAN>. Often, variables of the same type are grouped together to help the
compiler with alignment. Also, a lot of structs use macros like <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">PADLONG</SPAN> (<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">unix.h</SPAN> or
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">fwin.h</SPAN>) to pad a struct such that its size is a multiple of a built-in type size. This again
is to help with the data alignment.

<P>
Most struct elements have comments that explain their use. These commentaries often include 
the information where this element was once located in the old version 2 of FORM (it is the pair
of parentheses with or without a capital letter inside). Pointers come in two flavors: Some
pointers reference a dynamically allocated piece of memory, basically owning this memory. Others
just reference another variable or point into allocated memory. The first kind is usually marked
with <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">[D]</SPAN> for easy identification. These pointers often need to be treated particularly, e.g. during the
snapshot creation, when recovering, or when shutting down.

<P>
During start up (<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">main()</SPAN>), all the memory of these global structs, i.e. their element variables, is
initialized to zero.

<P>

<H2><A ID="SECTION00034000000000000000">
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">4</SPAN> Configuration</A>
</H2>

<P>
The source code evaluates several preprocessor definitions that can be defined by the user.
According to these definitions the executable can be configured in different ways. As a default, the
sequential version of FORM is generated. But if, for example, the preprocessor variable
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">WITHPTHREADS</SPAN> is defined, the multi-threaded version TFORM will be compiled. These preprocessor
variables can be set when calling the compiler, like

<P>
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">gcc -c -DWITHPTHREADS -o pre.o pre.c</SPAN>

<P>
The most commonly considered preprocessor variables are: 
<BR><SPAN style="font-family:monospace">WITHPTHREADS</SPAN>, <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">PARALLEL</SPAN>,
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">WITHZLIB</SPAN>, <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">WITHGMP</SPAN>, <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">WITHSORTBOTS</SPAN>, <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">LINUX</SPAN>, 
<BR><SPAN style="font-family:monospace">OPTERON</SPAN>, <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">DEBUGGING</SPAN>. The first two
change the flavor of the executable: TFORM or P<SMALL>AR</SMALL>FORM. The next two configure whether FORM uses
the zlib library for compression during sorts or the GMP library for arbitrary precision arithmetics.
The next decides whether FORM uses dedicated sorting  threads in TFORM. <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">LINUX</SPAN>
specifies that the executable is to be compiled for a Linux or UNIX compliant operating system. An
alternative here would be to set the variable <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">ALPHA</SPAN> or <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">MYWIN64</SPAN> instead, but these builds are
less common. <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">OPTERON</SPAN> has to be set if one compiles a 64bit executable. <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">DEBUGGING</SPAN> enables
some features for a non-release debugging version of the executable (commonly named <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">vorm</SPAN> or
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">tvorm</SPAN>).

<P>
When using the autoconf setup, the settings concerning the operating system, architecture (32/64bit), and
flavor of the executable are automatically done right. Additional settings like <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">WITHZLIB</SPAN> can be
changed by manually editing the file <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">config.h</SPAN>, which is included in <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">form3.h</SPAN>.

<P>
Version numbers and production date can also be set, but then one either needs to edit the
appropriate lines in <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">form3.h</SPAN> when in a manual compiling setup, or by editing <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">configure.ac</SPAN> in
an autoconf setup.

<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN> Discussion of a typical FORM run</A>

<P>
We discuss in the following what is happening inside FORM when it executes a
given program. The discussion focuses more on the interplay between the various
parts of FORM and on key concepts of the internal data representation than on
in-depth details of the code. For the latter, the reader is referred to section
<A HREF="#sec:indepth">4</A>. This section should for better comprehension be read with the
referenced FORM source files opened aside.

<P>
We consider the following exemplary FORM program <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">test.frm</SPAN> (which we run
with the command "<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">form test</SPAN>"):

<P>
<PRE>
 1      #define N "3"

 3      Symbol x, y, z;

</PRE>

<P>
The entry function <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">main()</SPAN> is in <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">startup.c</SPAN>. It does various
initializations before it calls the preprocessor <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">PreProcessor()</SPAN>, which
actually deals with the FORM program. The code shows some typical features:
Preprocessor macros are frequently used to select code specific to certain
configurations. The two most common macros can be seen here: <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">WITHPTHREADS</SPAN>
for a TFORM executable and <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">PARALLEL</SPAN> for a P<SMALL>AR</SMALL>FORM executable. Macros are
used to access the global data contained in the variable <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">A</SPAN>, like 
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">AX.timeout</SPAN> for example. The code uses (usually) own functions instead of
standard functions provided by the C library for common tasks. Examples in
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">main()</SPAN> are <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">strDup1</SPAN> or <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">MesPrint</SPAN> (replacing <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">printf()</SPAN>). Another
very often used function is <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">Malloc1()</SPAN> replacing <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">malloc()</SPAN>. The reasons
are better portability and the inclusion of special features.  <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">Malloc1()</SPAN> for
example makes a custom memory debugger available while <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">MesPrint()</SPAN> knows
among other things how to print encoded expressions from the internal buffers.

<P>
The initializations in <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">main()</SPAN> are done in several steps. Some like the
initialization of <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">A</SPAN> with zeros is done directly, most others are done by
calls to dedicated functions. The initializations are split up according to the
type of objects involved and the available information at this point. The
command line parameters passed to FORM (none in our example run) are treated
in the function <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">DoTail()</SPAN>. After that, files are opened and also parsed for
additional settings. Then, as all settings are known, the large part of the
internal data is allocated and initialized. Finally, recovery settings are
checked, threads are started if necessary, timers are started, and variable
initializations that might need to be repeated later (e.g. clear modules) are
done in <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">IniVars()</SPAN>.

<P>
The call to <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">OpenInput()</SPAN> reads the actual FORM program into memory. The
input is handled in an abstract fashion as character streams. The stream implementation
(<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">tools.c</SPAN>) offers several functions to open, close, and read from a stream.
Streams can be of different types including files, in-memory data like parts of
other streams or dollar variables, as well as external channels. The access to
the characters in all streams though is nicely uniform. In
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">OpenInput()</SPAN> a stream is representing our input file. Most of the logic
there deals with the jump to the requested module (skipping clear instructions).
It uses the function <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">GetInput()</SPAN> to get the next character in the stream.
Which stream it reads from is determined by the variable <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">AC.CurrentStream</SPAN>.
This global variable in the sub-struct <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">C_const</SPAN> of the <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">ALLGLOBALS</SPAN>
variable <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">A</SPAN> is an example of how the different parts of FORM typically
communicate with each other by means of global variables.

<P>
Next is the preprocessor. The preprocessor is implemented in the function
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">PreProcessor()</SPAN> in <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">pre.c</SPAN>. This function consists basically of two nested
for-loops without conditions (<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">for (;;) { ...}</SPAN>). The outer loop deals
with one FORM module for each iteration, the inner loop deals with one input
line. We have certain initializations done before in our example the code runs
into the inner loop, where <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">GetInput()</SPAN> reads our input file. The variables
are all set such that the reading starts from the beginning of out input file.

<P>
The input in variable <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">c</SPAN> is tested for special cases. Whitespaces are
skipped. Comments starting with a star <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">*</SPAN> (unless <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">AP.ComChar</SPAN> is set to a
different character) are also skipped including whole folds. The crucial check
on <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">c</SPAN> is the if-clause that checks it for being a preprocessor command (<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">#</SPAN>),
a module statement (<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">.</SPAN>), or something else which is usually an ordinary
statement.

<P>
<PRE>
 1      #define N "3"
</PRE>

<P>
In our case, we have a preprocessor command in the input. The function
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">PreProInstruction()</SPAN> is called to read and interpret the rest of the line.
The first part deals with the loading of the command in a dedicated buffer. For
the moment, we ignore the details for the special treatment of cases when we are
already inside a if or switch clause in a FORM program. In our run, the
function <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">LoadInstruction(0)</SPAN> is simply called.

<P>
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">LoadInstruction()</SPAN> copies input into the preprocessor instruction buffer.
Three variables govern this buffer: <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">AP.preStart</SPAN> points to the start of the
buffer, <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">AP.preFill</SPAN> to the point where new input can be copied to, and
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">AP.preStop</SPAN> to (roughly) the end of the buffer. This setup is quite typical
for buffers in FORM. The memory is allocated at the start of FORM. Later, like
at the end of <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">LoadInstruction()</SPAN>, if the buffer gets to small, it can be
replaced by a larger memory patch with the help of utility functions like
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">DoubleLList()</SPAN>. The contents is copied from the old to the new buffer. Since
this dynamical resizing of buffers needs to be done with most buffers
occasionally, most buffers in FORM store data such that it easily allows for
copying, i.e.  usually C pointers are avoided and instead numbers representing
offsets are used. Since the preprocessor instruction buffer just contains
characters there is no problem here.

<P>
In <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">LoadInstruction()</SPAN> with our input and the mode set to 5 the input is just
copied directly without any special actions taking except for a zero that is
added at the end of the data. <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">PreProInstruction()</SPAN> examines the data in the
preprocessor instruction buffer for special cases, and then does a look-up in
the <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">precommands</SPAN> variable. This is a vector of type <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">KEYWORD</SPAN> which enables
the translation of a string (the command) to a function pointer (the C function
that performs the operations requested by preprocessor command).
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">FindKeyword()</SPAN> does these translations and the found function pointer is then
dereferenced with the rest of the input in the instruction buffer as an argument.

<P>
The function pointer will point to <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">DoDefine()</SPAN> in our case. <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">DoDefine()</SPAN>
just calls <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">TheDefine()</SPAN> that does the work. The if-clauses for 
<BR><SPAN style="font-family:monospace">AP.PreSwitchModes</SPAN> and <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">AP.PreIfStack</SPAN> are present in most of the
functions dealing with preprocessor commands. They check whether we are in a
preprocessor if or switch block that is not to be considered, because the
condition didn't hold. Then, the standard action is to just exit the current
function leaving it with no effect. Since there are preprocessor commands like
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">#else</SPAN> or <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">#endif</SPAN> this decision can only be taken at this level of the
execution and requires the repeated use of this idiom.

<P>
The function scans through possible arguments and the value. In the value, special
characters are interpreted. Ultimately, the preprocessor variable is created and
assigned in the called function <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">PutPreVar()</SPAN>. The variable <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">chartype</SPAN>
deserves an explanation. One will find it used very often in the C code that
does input parsing. <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">chartype</SPAN> is actually a macro standing in for
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">FG.cTable</SPAN>. This global, statically initialized (in <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">inivar.h</SPAN>) vector
contains a value of every possible ASCII character describing its parsing type.
The parsing type groups different ASCII characters such that the syntax checking
is facilitated, see <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">inivar.h</SPAN> for details.

<P>
In <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">PutPreVar()</SPAN> we get into the details of the name administration. We will
just comment on some of the more general features. <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">NumPre</SPAN> and <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">PreVar</SPAN> are
macros to access elements in <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">AP.PreVarList</SPAN>. The type of <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">AP.PreVarList</SPAN> is
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">LIST</SPAN>. This is a generic type for all kinds of lists and it is used for many
other variables in FORM. A <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">LIST</SPAN> stores list entries in a piece of
dynamically allocated memory that has no defined type (<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">void *</SPAN>). The utility
functions for managing <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">LIST</SPAN>s like <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">FromList()</SPAN> are ignorant about the
actual contents and perform list-specific operations like adding, removing or
resizing a list. An actual entry can be accessed by some pointer arithmetic and
type casting. The <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">PreVar</SPAN> macro contains such a cast to the type <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">PREVAR</SPAN>
which represents a preprocessor variable.

<P>
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">PutPreVar()</SPAN> creates a new list entry for us and basically copies the
contents of the parameter <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">value</SPAN> to the memory allocated to <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">PREVAR</SPAN>'s
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">name</SPAN>. So, by writing <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">PreVar[0]-&gt;name</SPAN> or <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">PreVar[0]-&gt;value</SPAN> we could
access the strings <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">N</SPAN> or <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">3</SPAN>.

<P>
In <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">TheDefine()</SPAN> the function <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">Terminate()</SPAN> is used several times. This
function ultimately exits the program, but first tries to clean up things and
print information about the problems causing this program termination.

<P>
<PRE>
 2      
 3      Symbol x, y, z;
</PRE>

<P>
In our run, we return to the function <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">PreProcessor()</SPAN> and start a new inner
loop iteration that reads a new line. After skipping the empty line we end up
in the else-branch of the big if-clause testing <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">c</SPAN> this time. Here the major
steps are: we check again whether we are in a preprocessor if or switch, call
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">LoadStatement()</SPAN> to read and prepare the input, and call
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">CompileStatement()</SPAN> to perform the actions requested by the statement. Th
programs enters the compiler stage.

<P>
We also see a call to <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">UngetChar()</SPAN>, which puts back the character that has
been read into the input stream. This is necessary, because 
<BR><SPAN style="font-family:monospace">LoadStatement()</SPAN> and <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">CompileStatement()</SPAN> need the complete line for
parsing. The variable <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">AP.PreContinuation</SPAN> is used several times. This variable
deals with statements that span several input lines. <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">LoadStatement()</SPAN> can
recognize unfinished statements and sets this variable accordingly.

<P>
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">LoadStatement()</SPAN> basically copies the input to the compiler's input buffer at
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">AC.iBuffer</SPAN> (which has <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">AC.iPointer</SPAN> and <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">AC.iStop</SPAN> associated to it). It
modifies the copy if necessary. The modification are to replace spaces by commas
or insert commas at the right spots to separate tokens. The interpretation steps
that are following rely on these synactic conventions.

<P>
The call to <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">CompileStatement()</SPAN> is done only if no errors occurred and all
lines of a statement have been gathered into the compiler's input buffer.
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">CompileStatement()</SPAN> is called with the address of this input buffer and tries
to identify the statement. Like in the preprocessor, the input string is search
in a vector of <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">KEYWORD</SPAN>s (in <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">compiler.c</SPAN> and if found, a function pointer
is dereferenced to the function that actually deals with the command and its
options and arguments.  Here, we have actually two vectors of <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">KEYWORD</SPAN>s,
because some statements might be stated in abbreviated form. The function
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">findcommand()</SPAN> deals with the search. <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">CompileStatement()</SPAN> does some small
extra work, like for example checking the correct order of statements. In our
case, it calls the function <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">CoSymbol()</SPAN>. This functions is in file
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">name.c</SPAN>, because as a declaration it basically adds something to the name
administration. Functions for other statements can be found in <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">compcomm.c</SPAN>
and <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">compexpr.c</SPAN>.

<P>
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">CoSymbol()</SPAN> loops over the arguments and adds proper variable names together
with their options to the symbols list <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">AC.Symbols</SPAN> and the name
administration (in the call to <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">AddSymbol()</SPAN>.  In our case, we have <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">x</SPAN>,
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">y</SPAN>, and <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">z</SPAN> added. We have already encountered the basic mechanism of how a
specific struct is added to a <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">LIST</SPAN>. The name administration was not
explained before, though.

<P>
Symbols can appear in expressions that need to be encoded. The coding for
symbols can simply be its entry index in the list <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">AC.Symbols</SPAN>, but symbols
also need to be recognized when an expression is parsed. Therefore a efficient
look-up mechanism is required. This is achieved by a second data structure that
holds the name strings in a tree for fast searching. The data in the symbol list
does not contain the name string itself, but contains a reference (a index) into
this name string tree. The tree is managed by generalized functions and types
that are also used for other, similar objects like vectors, indices, etc. The
functions for name trees are located in the first part of the file <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">name.c</SPAN>.
The types <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">NAMENODE</SPAN> and <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">NAMETREE</SPAN> are defined in <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">structs.h</SPAN>.
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">NAMENODE</SPAN>s are the node of a balanced binary tree. It does not hold the
name string just an index into <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">NAMETREE</SPAN>. The actual data is contained in 
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">NAMETREE</SPAN> that constitute one tree. This type has buffers for the nodes and
for the name strings. This has the benefit of avoiding small malloc calls for
individual nodes. Also, since all referencing is done via offsets into these
buffers, a relocation or serialization of such a tree is very easy. In the
struct <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">C_const</SPAN> (aka the global <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">AC</SPAN>) several name trees are defined, for
dollar variables, expressions, etc. The symbols added in our example program go
into the nametree referenced by <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">AC.activenames</SPAN>, which is at this point equal
to <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">AC.varnames</SPAN>.

<P>
Our program returns to the <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">PreProcessor()</SPAN> and starts parsing the next lines:

<P>
<PRE>
 5      L	f = (x+y)^2 - (x+z)^`N';
 6      L	g = f - x;
</PRE>

<P>
This time the function <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">DoExpr()</SPAN> will get called (via <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">CoLocal()</SPAN>) for each
line to do the parsing.  The function <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">DoExpr()</SPAN> first tries to figure out
what type of <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">Local</SPAN> statement we have. In our cases we have an actual
assignment. With the call to <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">GetVar()</SPAN> we check whether a variable of the same
name already exists. The search is done in the nametrees <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">AC.varnames</SPAN> and
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">AC.exprnames</SPAN>. Since our names are new we don't find a previous variable and
simply call <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">EntVar()</SPAN>. <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">EntVar()</SPAN> creates an entry in <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">AC.ExpressionList</SPAN>
and puts the name into the <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">AC.exprnames</SPAN> nametree. The entry in
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">AC.ExpressionList</SPAN> is of type <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">struct ExPrEsSiOn</SPAN>. There are more struct
elements than in the case of symbols, but the principle is the same. Up to now,
the right-hand-side (RHS) has not been looked at and therefore no information
about it is saved in the expression's entry yet. The connection between the
expression's entry in the <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">AC.ExpressionList</SPAN> and the data containing the RHS
will be made via the elements <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">prototype</SPAN> and <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">onfile</SPAN> as we will describe
soon.  The access to elements in <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">AC.ExpressionList</SPAN> is facilitated by the
macro <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">Expressions</SPAN>. The following code in <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">DoExpr()</SPAN> builds up a so-called
prototype and puts the RHS in encoded form into the buffer system via the call
to <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">CompileAlgebra()</SPAN>.

<P>
FORM uses the allocated memory in <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">AT.WorkSpace</SPAN> for operations like the
generation of terms. This memory stores <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">WORD</SPAN>s and is used in a stack-like
fashion with the help of the pointer <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">AT.WorkPointer</SPAN>. A function can write to
this memory and set <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">AT.WorkPointer</SPAN> beyond the written data to insure that
other functions that are called and might use the workspace as well do not
overwrite this data. It is the responsibility of the function to reset
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">AT.WorkPointer</SPAN> to its original value again (see variable <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">OldWork</SPAN> in our
case). Every thread in TFORM will have its own private work space.

<P>
FORM now uses <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">AT.WorkSpace</SPAN> to build up a data structure that contains
everything that needs to be known at a later stage about the expression that is
parsed. The creation and the layout of the data is quite typical. First comes a
header that signifies what is coming. Here, it is <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">TYPEEXPRESSION</SPAN>. Then comes
the length of the whole data, i.e. the total number of occupied <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">WORD</SPAN>s. The
actual contents is following, which is a so-called subexpression that we will
discuss soon. The contents is followed by a coefficient and a zero, which
signifies the end of the data.

<P>
<B>Coefficients</B> are coded in FORM always in the following manner: Since
coefficients can in general be fractional numbers, we encode an integer
numerator and an integer denominator. The integers can have arbitrary length
(limited only by the buffer sizes, see the setup variables <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">MaxNumberSize</SPAN> and
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">MaxTermSize</SPAN>) and are encoded in <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">WORD</SPAN>-pieces in little-endian convention.
The number of allocated <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">WORD</SPAN>s is always the same for the numerator and the
denominator. The last word of the coefficient contains the size of the whole
coefficient in words. The formal structure of a coefficients is therefore like
this:
<DIV class="CENTER">
<I>NUMERATOR WORDS, DENOMINATOR WORDS, LENGTH</I>.

</DIV>
The integers are always
unsigned, i.e. positive. Negative fractions are encoded by a negative length.
Examples (with 16bit words): <!-- MATH
 $2^{16}+2 = 65538$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 STYLE="height: 2.55ex; vertical-align: -0.30ex; " SRC="img2.svg"
 ALT="$2^{16}+2 = 65538$"></SPAN> gives words 2,1,1,0,5 and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 STYLE="height: 2.74ex; vertical-align: -0.69ex; " SRC="img3.svg"
 ALT="$-5/2$"></SPAN>
gives <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 STYLE="height: 2.37ex; vertical-align: -0.56ex; " SRC="img4.svg"
 ALT="$5,2,-3$"></SPAN>.

<P>
The data structure in <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">AT.WorkSpace</SPAN> is basically an instruction for the
generator, a central function that does the main work during the execution of
the FORM program, to generate an expression. The content of the expression is
a subexpression. This is a pointer to the real content of the expression and
will be substituted later after the execution. The main reason for this delayed
expression insertion is that it can often save a lot of intermediate operations
and data space and thereby speed up FORM. A case where such a thing can happen
is, when an expression is used at different places and the different parts are
brought together by some operations. Then, cancellations may occur or terms can
be factored out and when the expressions finally is inserted the workload is
less.

<P>
In our example run, the data that will later instruct the generator to 
create an expression looks in total like this:

<P>
<DIV class="CENTER">
<I>TYPEEXPRESSION, SUBEXPSIZE+3, 9, SUBEXPRESSION, 
<BR>
SUBEXPSIZE, 0, 1, AC.cbufnum, 1, 1, 3, 0</I>

</DIV>

<P>
We used the macro names as in the actual code. <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">AC.cbufnum</SPAN> is a variable that
is the index of the compile buffer used for this parsed statement.
At the end of the data preparation phase the pointer <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">AT.WorkPointer</SPAN> is set
beyond the data on the trailing zero, the pointer <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">AT.ProtoType</SPAN>, which is
used soon in following functions is set to the word <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">SUBEXPRESSION</SPAN>.

<P>
The expression will be put into the scratch buffer system. This system comprises
the small and large buffers and the scratch files. Where new data to the scratch
buffers will be stored is of no concern to a function like <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">DoExpr()</SPAN>, it
simply uses several utility functions for that purpose. Still, we need to
initialize the variable <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">pos</SPAN> here that will indicate the position of the
data, i.e. the expression, in the scratch file.

<P>
Next, the function <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">CompileAlgebra()</SPAN> is called to parse the right hand side
and put the codified expression into the FORM buffers. It basically calls two
functions: <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">tokenize</SPAN> and <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">CompileSubExpressions</SPAN>. <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">tokenize</SPAN> is the
tokenizer that translates the input character string in a sanitized and partly
interpreted string of codes. It will look up the variables named in the input
string and put the index they have in the name administration into the tokenized
output. Our input string is transformed into the code string like this

<P>
<PRE>
   (     -13  LPARENTHESIS
   x      -1  TSYMBOL
           5
   +     -26  TPLUS
   y      -1  TSYMBOL
           6
   )     -14  RPARENTHESIS
   ^     -25  TPOWER
   2      -8  TNUMBER
           2
   -     -27  TMINUS
   (     -13  LPARENTHESIS
   x      -1  TSYMBOL
           5
   +     -26  TPLUS
   z      -1  TSYMBOL
           7
   )     -14  RPARENTHESIS
   ^     -25  TPOWER
   `N'    -8  TNUMBER
           3
         -29  TENDOFIT
</PRE>

<P>
This code string then lies in the <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">AC.tokens</SPAN> buffer where it is used by
subsequent functions.

<P>
The function <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">CompileSubExpression()</SPAN> finds terms in an expression that might
be reused at another place and extracts them. As one can see in the code, the
function looks for terms in parentheses and works recursively. The end of such a
term is each time marked with <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">TENDOFIT</SPAN>. Then, the function
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">CodeGenerator()</SPAN> called at the end of <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">CompileSubExpression()</SPAN> does the
real work.

<P>
In our example <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">CodeGenerator()</SPAN> first gets the data
<DIV class="CENTER">
<I>LPARENTHESIS, TSYMBOL, 5, TPLUS, TSYMBOL, 6, TENDOFIT</I>

</DIV>
as a parameter, which is the term <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 STYLE="height: 2.22ex; vertical-align: -0.56ex; " SRC="img5.svg"
 ALT="$x+y$"></SPAN>. It builds up the actual term encoding
in the workspace and first reserves for that enough space there. One can see the
pointer arithmetic using constants like <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">AM.MaxTal</SPAN>, which is the maximum
number of words a number can occupy. It reserves space for the coefficient, an
integer, and the actual term. Once a token is recognized, the equivalent term
data is written to the workspace and the function <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">CompleteTerm</SPAN> is called.
This function completes the data to
<DIV class="CENTER">
<I>8, 1, 4, 5, 1, 1, 1, 3, 0</I>. 

</DIV>
The first word is the total length, i.e. 8 words. This is the length of the
whole expression. The second word is the type of the term, which is a symbol. It
is the value <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">SYMBOL</SPAN> as defined in <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">ftypes.h</SPAN>. This macro definition
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">SYMBOL</SPAN> has the value 1 (in the FORM version at this time this reference is
written). Following the type signifying word is the length of the term, which is
4. Several such terms could follow each other, but we only have one term at the
moment. Finally, we have the trailing words for the coefficient being 1 and a
terminating zero. The meaning and interpretation of the words in the data of a
single term after the type word and the length word are dependent on the type.
For symbols, we have pairs of word, where the first word is the index of the
symbol in the name administration and the second word is the exponent. Here we
have symbol 5 (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 STYLE="height: 1.42ex; vertical-align: -0.11ex; " SRC="img6.svg"
 ALT="$= x$"></SPAN>) with an exponent 1.  After <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">CompleteTerm()</SPAN> has
constructed the whole expression it copies the data to the compile buffers with
the help of the function <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">AddNtoC()</SPAN>.

<P>
The compile buffers contain the instruction for the execution engine, the
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">Processor()</SPAN>, that will start when the <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">.sort</SPAN> command is parsed. Our terms
are put into the right-hand-side buffers in the compile buffer. When the
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">Processor()</SPAN> will read these buffers one after the other, it will take the
terms and put them into the scratch buffer system. Then, they become the
expressions upon which further statements do act. The compile buffers are stored
in the list <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">AC.cbufList</SPAN> and we get access to the elements via the cast
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">((CBUF *)(AC.cbufList.lijst))</SPAN>. This cast is defined as a preprocessor macro
called <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">cbuf</SPAN>. The element <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">cbuf[0]-&gt;numrhs</SPAN> (0 is the current compile
buffer we are using) gives the number of entries in <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">cbuf[0]-&gt;rhs</SPAN>, which is
an array of pointer into <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">cbuf[0]-&gt;Buffer</SPAN>. We have 3 elements:

<P>
<PRE>
  cbuf[0]-&gt;rhs[1]   --&gt;
     8, 1, 4, 5, 1, 1, 1, 3, 8, 1, 4, 6, 1, 1, 1, 3, 0
  cbuf[0]-&gt;rhs[2]   --&gt;
     8, 1, 4, 5, 1, 1, 1, 3, 8, 1, 4, 7, 1, 1, 1, 3, 0
  cbuf[0]-&gt;rhs[3]   --&gt;
     9, 6, 5, 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 3, 9, 6, 5, 2, 3, 0, 1, 1, -3, 0
</PRE>

<P>
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">cbuf[0]-&gt;rhs[0]</SPAN> is not used and the data lies consecutively in 
<BR><SPAN style="font-family:monospace">cbuf[0]-&gt;Buffer</SPAN>. The meaning of the first two entries has already been
explained. These are expressions containing <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 STYLE="height: 2.22ex; vertical-align: -0.56ex; " SRC="img5.svg"
 ALT="$x+y$"></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 STYLE="height: 1.97ex; vertical-align: -0.30ex; " SRC="img7.svg"
 ALT="$x+z$"></SPAN>, respectively.
The last expression uses subexpressions that have the type <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">SUBEXPRESSION</SPAN>
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 STYLE="height: 1.92ex; vertical-align: -0.11ex; " SRC="img8.svg"
 ALT="$= 6$"></SPAN>. The length of a subexpression is 5 and the contents <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 STYLE="height: 2.37ex; vertical-align: -0.56ex; " SRC="img9.svg"
 ALT="$1,2,0$"></SPAN> means
that expression 1 needs to be inserted with an exponent of 2. The zero is a
dirty flag that signals to the processor the state of the subexpression. Here in
the compile buffers it is simply cleared to zero. The contents <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 STYLE="height: 2.37ex; vertical-align: -0.56ex; " SRC="img10.svg"
 ALT="$2,3,0$"></SPAN> of the
second subexpression should be obvious. Finally, we have an negative
coefficient for the second subexpression which accounts for the minus sign
between the parentheses in our original expression.

<P>
We return to the function <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">DoExpr()</SPAN> where the prototype of the expression is
put into the scratch system via the call <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">PutOut()</SPAN> and we are finished with
this line in the input file. The next line defining a second local expression
works the same.

<P>
We come to the parsing of the following statements:

<P>
<PRE>
 7      
 8      Brackets x;
 9      Print;
</PRE>

<P>
The bracket statement is dealt with in function <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">DoBrackets()</SPAN>. It sets the
flag <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">AR.BracketOn</SPAN> to 1 and constructs the term that will stand outside the
bracket. This term is copied into the <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">AT.BrackBuf</SPAN> buffer, where it can be
used by the execution engine when it needs to insert this heading term into an
expression.

<P>
The print statement is parsed in function <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">DoPrint()</SPAN>. Since we don't have any
arguments to <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">Print</SPAN> all active expressions shall be printed.
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">DoPrint()</SPAN> just loops through the <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">Expressions</SPAN> list and sets the
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">printflag</SPAN> to 1 for each expression.

<P>
With the next statement in our input file

<P>
<PRE>
10      .sort
</PRE>

<P>
we will get to know the other central parts of FORM: the processor and the
sorting routines. The code in the <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">PreProcessor()</SPAN> will call
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">ExecModule()</SPAN>
which calls <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">DoExecute()</SPAN>. We can ignore a lot of code there that is only for
parallelized versions of FORM. There are three important functions calls
happening. First, <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">RevertScratch()</SPAN> is called. FORM uses three scratch
buffers: input buffer, output buffer, and the hide buffer. The usual mode of
operation is to apply statements on expressions in the input buffer, sort and
normalize the result, and write it into the output buffer. This repeats for
every executing module and therefore an important optimization is made: the
input buffer and the output buffer simply change their roles.
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">RevertScratch()</SPAN> does this job.  The second and third important calls are to
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">Processor()</SPAN> and <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">WriteAll()</SPAN>. 

<P>
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">Processor()</SPAN> is, as the name suggests, the main processor that executes
statements and deals with the results. A lot of initialization work is done
before we go into the large loop over the expressions that spans almost the
whole function. Our expressions have as regular expressions from the scratch
buffers the <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">inmem</SPAN> flag set to zero, so we go into the else branch of the
checking if-clause. There we go to the case of a <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">LOCALEXPRESSION</SPAN>. The main
logic here is to do a single call to <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">GetTerm()</SPAN> to get the first term from
the input file and copy that to the output with the call to <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">PutOut()</SPAN>. This
first term, which is a subexpression, serves as a header for the expression. It
follows a (while-)loop that calls <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">GetTerm()</SPAN>, and if there are still terms,
the loop executes its body and calls <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">Generator()</SPAN>. After this loop, some
clean-up and a final <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">EndSort()</SPAN> is done, before the outer loop over the
expressions repeats. <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">Generator()</SPAN> is the function where the read input, which
is <I>9, 6, 5, 3, 1, 0, 1, 1, 3</I>, will be substituted and expanded.

<P>
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">Generator()</SPAN> gets the term in the workspace and first tries to do all
substitutions (<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">SUBEXPRESSION</SPAN>), then applies the statements in the compile
buffers to the normalized terms, substitutes again if necessary, do brackets,
and finally sorts the result.

<P>
The call to <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">TestSub()</SPAN> does the search for subexpressions. <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">TestSub()</SPAN> will
find a subexpression in our case and return the number (3) of this subexpression
and set other global variables ready for the following steps. In <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">Generator()</SPAN>
we enter therefore the if-clause checking <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">replac</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 STYLE="height: 2.01ex; vertical-align: -0.20ex; " SRC="img11.svg"
 ALT="$&gt; 0$"></SPAN>.  Depending on the
power of the subexpression different operations are taken. We have our
subexpression to the power one only, which is an easy case. The actual
substitution is performed by the function <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">InsertTerm()</SPAN>. Since the new term
might again contain subexpressions we do a recursive call to <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">Generator()</SPAN>.
Our expression contains several layers of subexpressions which are all dealt
with as described above. Only the powers of the other subexpressions are
different from one, so we get slightly more work to be done which involves the
expansion of the terms using binomials. 

<P>
Finally, the call to <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">TestSub()</SPAN> at the beginning of <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">Generator()</SPAN> will
return zero. The function <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">Normalize()</SPAN> is called, which puts the terms in a
canonical form, i.e. terms are ordered and collected with the correct
coefficient. In our example, as the first fully substituted term we have
<I>12, 1, 4, 6, 1, 1, 4, 6, 1, 1, 1, 3</I> before the call to
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">Normalize()</SPAN>, which means we have a term <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 STYLE="height: 1.50ex; vertical-align: -0.11ex; " SRC="img12.svg"
 ALT="$x*x$"></SPAN>. <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">Normalize()</SPAN>
makes this into <I>8, 1, 4, 6, 2, 1, 1, 3</I>, which is <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 STYLE="height: 2.35ex; vertical-align: -0.11ex; " SRC="img13.svg"
 ALT="$x^2$"></SPAN>.

<P>
Then, we loop over the statements in the compile buffer. <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">level</SPAN> is the
instruction counter. We have a long switch-clause that interprets the statement
type identifiers like <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">TYPECOUNT</SPAN>. Statements with <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">TYPEEXPRESSION</SPAN> are not
treated here. So we loop over all the compile buffer statements here and only
call <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">TestMatch()</SPAN> at the loop's end. This function has no effect in our
example, because we have no pattern matching going on.

<P>
Then, the function <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">PutBracket()</SPAN> is called to deal with brackets. Brackets
are implemented by putting the special code <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">HAAKJE</SPAN> inside the expression.
The terms before the <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">HAAKJE</SPAN> are outside the bracket, everything following it
will be inside the bracket. 

<P>
At the end of the loop over the terms in the expressions, the function
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">StoreTerm()</SPAN> is called. This function puts the result of the processing in
the output scratch buffers. Finally, we return to <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">Processor()</SPAN>. There the
final sorting is started. Also, the printing of the expressions is done here.

<P>
The parsing in <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">PreProcessor()</SPAN> continues with

<P>
<PRE>
11      
12      #do i=2,3
13      Id	x?^`i' = x;
14      #enddo
</PRE>

<P>
Here we have a somewhat more complicated example of preprocessor instructions.
The do-loop is treated in <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">DoDo()</SPAN> which sets up data structures (<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">DOLOOP</SPAN>)
to guide the preprocessor when it is parsing the loop body. The statement line
will then be presented to the compiler two times and with the correct values of
the preprocessor variable <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">i</SPAN>. The compiler deals with this statement in
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">CoId()</SPAN> which is just calling <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">CoIdExpression()</SPAN>.  <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">CoIdExpression()</SPAN>
puts a <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">TYPEIDNEW</SPAN> code into the lhs compile buffer. This tells the processor
later how to do the pattern matching. The rhs is the term <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">x</SPAN> that will be
inserted.

<P>
The parsing continues and ends with

<P>
<PRE>
15      
16      Print +s;
17      .end
</PRE>

<P>
The way these statements are treated and how the program is executed has already
been described. The pattern matching is something that has not occurred before,
though. We will not describe it here, since there is a dedicated section in this
manual for that. After the final sorting, FORM will clean up temporary files and
other resources that are not automatically freed by the operating system before
FORM ends itself.

<SPAN CLASS="arabic">4</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN> The problem of dummy indices</A>
</H2>

<P>
FORM has a indices that can be automatically renumbered. With this we mean 
that when we have an expression like

<P>
<PRE>
f(i)*g(i)*h(j)*k(j)-f(j)*g(j)*h(i)*k(i)
</PRE>

<P>
we can say

<P>
<PRE>
Sum i,j;
</PRE>

<P>
and FORM will change the expression into

<P>
<PRE>
f(N1_?)*g(N1_?)*h(N2_?)*k(N2_?)-f(N2_?)*g(N2_?)*h(N1_?)*k(N1_?)
</PRE>

<P>
in which <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">Ni_?</SPAN> are internal indices.

<P>
These internal indices follow a number of rules:

<OL>
<LI>their numbers (<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">AC.CurDum</SPAN>) start at <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">AM.IndDum</SPAN>, which again starts at 
   <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">AM.DumInd+WILDOFFSET</SPAN> and <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">AM.DumInd</SPAN> starts at <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">AM.OffsetIndex + 2*WILDOFFSET</SPAN>.
   Hence <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">AC.CurDum</SPAN> starts at <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">AM.OffsetIndex +
<BR>
3*WILDOFFSET</SPAN>.
   Because we need this extra space <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">WILDOFFSET</SPAN> cannot be too large and this 
   limits the number of indices that is allowed.
</LI>
<LI>The dimension of the dummy indices is equal to the default dimension.
</LI>
<LI>The internal (dummy) indices can be renamed at any time in order to 
   create uniquely minimal terms. In the above expression that would mean 
   that the second term would be 'rearranged' into
<PRE>
f(N2_?)*g(N2_?)*h(N1_?)*k(N1_?) --&gt;
                          f(N1_?)*g(N1_?)*h(N2_?)*k(N2_?)
</PRE>
   and the expression becomes zero.
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
There are problems with this concept.

<OL>
<LI>Multiplying expressions with dummy indices could give a repetition of 
	the same indices as in <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">(f(N1_?)*g(N1_?))ˆ3</SPAN>. This has been solved 
   partially as can be seen with the following program:
<PRE>
   CF  f,g;
   L   F = (f(N1_?)*g(N1_?))^3;
   L   G = f(N1_?)*g(N1_?);
   .sort
   L   G3 = G^3;
   Print;
   .end
</PRE>
   The routine that takes care of the proper shifts in dummy numbers is
   <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">MoveDummies()</SPAN>. As one can see from the example, the <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">SUBEXPRESSION</SPAN> to a
   power isn't treated this way. It would have a serious impact on the
   speed. With the <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">Gˆ3</SPAN> it is different because that is slower to begin
   with.
</LI>
<LI>Keep Brackets is extremely dangerous. The problem here is
<PRE>
f(N1_?)*(g(N1_?)*h(N2_?)*k(N2_?)+g(N2_?)*h(N1_?)*k(N2_?))
</PRE>
   What is inside the brackets is invisible during the module. Hence a 
   renumbering that involves <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">f(N1_?)</SPAN> only can change <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">N1_?</SPAN> into <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">N2?_</SPAN>
   (FORM doesn't know there is already a <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">N2_?</SPAN>) and anyway, the 
   corresponding <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">N1_?</SPAN> remains as it is.
   It means that there are complicatetions with <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">Sum</SPAN>, <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">Trace4</SPAN> and things like
   <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">id  p = f(?);</SPAN> which can generate dummy indices.
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
The second problem requires some action.

<I>Note (JV)</I>: I am not sure why there are unused regions. I must have had a 
reason for them, but I have forgotten about it (it was more than 20 years 
ago). And then, maybe it is used somewhere in a totally untransparent way.

<P>
<I>Note 2 (JV)</I>: It was good to make this list. It turned out that in several 
places the code that checks for wildcard indices was only limited from 
below, not from above. It would of course be very rare to run into trouble 
with this, but it is better to have the code formally correct. One never 
knows. This was particularly the case in <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">FindRest()</SPAN> (in <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">findpat.c</SPAN>). There may 
be more. It is best to repair this, whenever encountered.

<BR><SPAN style="font-family:monospace">5*WILDOFFSET+AM.OffsetIndex+nTraceDummies &lt; 2ˆ15</SPAN> 
<BR>
in which <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">nTraceDummies</SPAN> is the number of dummies that can be introduced when 
taking a 4-dimensional trace.

<P>
If we assume that we will not take traces of more than 200 gamma matrices 
(each with a different index, because otherwise there are contractions) 
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">nTraceDummies</SPAN> will be at most 100. <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">AM.OffsetIndex</SPAN> is by default 128.
The value that we selected for <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">WILDOFFSET</SPAN> is 6100 which allows a maximum 
value of 2167 for <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">AM.OffsetIndex</SPAN>.

<H1><A ID="SECTION00060000000000000000">
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">5</SPAN> The test suite</A>
</H1>

<P>
The subdirectory <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">check</SPAN> contains a test suite for FORM. Using the autoconf
facilities the checks can be started with the command <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">make check</SPAN>.
Otherwise, one can issue the command <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">ruby form.rb</SPAN> in the <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">check</SPAN>
directory.

<P>
The test suite is written in the language
Ruby<A ID="tex2html1"
  HREF="#foot910"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN></SUP></A>. Ruby itself already offers a
unit testing framework and this is used with as minimal as possible extensions
to make the creation of test cases for FORM programs easy. All the extensions
to the built-in Ruby testing framework (<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">Test::Unit</SPAN>) are contained in the
file <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">form.rb</SPAN>. This file also contains code to load test cases from other
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">*.rb</SPAN> files in the <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">check</SPAN> directory. Therefore all test cases are
contained in appropriately named <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">*.rb</SPAN> files. The makefile's purpose is to
integrate the call <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">ruby form.rb</SPAN> into the autoconf system.

<P>
<I>Side note:</I>
The choice to use Ruby and its built-in test framework was taken for several
reasons: It makes sense to use or adapt already existing testing frameworks in
order to keep the extra cost of maintenance as low as possible for the FORM programmers. There are numerous systems available on the market, some are part
of a language runtime environment (libraries), and some are dedicated programs
with a custom configuration language. Since the tests for FORM programs center
mainly about text processing, i.e. comparing the textual FORM output to a
correct answer, we need powerful text processing facilities like pattern
matching. But we also need file operations and information from the operating
system to check the run of a FORM program, eventually. All this is readily
available in the testing frameworks of scripting languages, like Ruby, Python,
or Tcl. Ruby was ultimately chosen, because the mixing of FORM code with the
steering scripting language code looked nicest, and the small amount of extra
(Ruby) syntax necessary makes it convenient to add new test cases.

<P>
A new test case can be implemented in the following way. First of all, we need a
FORM program that is to be run. It might be a program that exhibits an actual
bug in (a previous version of) FORM or that contains generic code that should
be guaranteed to work, also in coming releases of FORM. It might also be code
that deliberately crashes FORM or causes other errors, like syntax errors, if
this behavior of FORM is to be assumed. Usually, the FORM program is rather
short or can be made such. In this case, we are going to mix the Ruby and the
FORM code in one file. Alternatively, the FORM program can also be kept in a
separate file. This option will be discussed later.

<P>
Now, either one choses an existing <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">*.rb</SPAN> file (not <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">form.rb</SPAN>) or starts a
new one. The name of the file should fit the test case scenario. In this file we
need to define a Ruby class that will contain our FORM code as well as the
checks (assertions) we want to impose on the run.

<P>
The generic frame of this test case definition looks like this:

<P>
<PRE>
  class [Test name] &lt; FormTest
  def setup
    [Setup code, usually this includes the FORM program code]
  end
  def test1
    [Execution code, and the assertion and testing code]
  end
  end
</PRE>

<P>
The text in the brackets [ ] needs to be filled with our specific code. The
details of the Ruby code itself will be explained later. For a start, it is
usually advisable just to copy an existing test case and modify it.

<P>
Every class defined in this way will be used for the testing. First, Ruby will
run the code in the class method <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">setup</SPAN>, and then it runs <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">test1</SPAN>.

<P>
A complete test might look like this:

<P>
<PRE>
  class SymbolIdTest &lt; FormTest
  def setup
    input &lt;&lt;-EOF
  S x, y;
  L f = (x+y)^100;
  id x = y;
  print;
  .end
    EOF
  end
  def test1
    execute FORM
    assert no_problem
    assert result("f") =~ 
        pattern("1267650600228229401496703205376*y^100;")
  end
  end
</PRE>

<P>
We have chose the name <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">SymbolIdTest</SPAN> for our class. We defined the FORM program in-line with a so called here document (<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">«-EOF ... EOF</SPAN>). We do run
the FORM executable. Alternatives would be TFORM, for example. The assertions
we have are that no problem occurred, i.e. no syntax error, no runtime error, or
similar things. We also check the output of our FORM program. We compare via
pattern matching the result of the expression <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">f</SPAN> with the correct answer. The
function <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">result()</SPAN> extracts the appropriate line from the output, <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">=˜</SPAN> is
the pattern matching operator in Ruby, and the function <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">pattern()</SPAN> prepares
special characters like the caret (ˆ) for the pattern matcher.

<P>
Next time we run the test suite, our test will be run as well. If no assertions
are violated, we will only see the number of successful tests and assertions
increased in the summary output.

<P>
Even though the extra Ruby syntax is kept to a minimum and is rather
straightforward, some remarks about the Ruby language are useful here. Classes
are defined by the keyword <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">class</SPAN>, and methods (or functions) are declared
with the keyword <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">def</SPAN>. These definitions are always ended with the keyword
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">end</SPAN>. <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">FormTest</SPAN> is a class defined in <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">form.rb</SPAN> that contains all the
special code for FORM test and that is derived from the built-in Ruby test
case class <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">TestCase</SPAN>. For every test case we derive again from this class
(<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">class B &lt; A</SPAN> says that <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">B</SPAN> is derived from <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">A</SPAN>). We don't need
semicolons to end a line and indentation is arbitrary. Class names should be
capitalized. In Ruby, parentheses around the arguments of functions can often be
omitted. We use this possibility when we call the functions <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">input</SPAN>,
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">execute</SPAN>, and <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">assert</SPAN>. We could have written <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">execute(FORM)</SPAN> as well,
for example. The here document (<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">«-EOF ... EOF</SPAN>) can also use other markers
instead of <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">EOF</SPAN>, of course. The minus sign before <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">EOF</SPAN> allows the end
marker to be indented. Comments are started with a #.

<P>
One class can actually contain more than one test. The testing framework will
call the method <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">setup</SPAN> and then a method whose name starts with <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">test</SPAN>
(Note: in newer versions of Ruby the name could be just <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">test</SPAN>, but older
versions (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 STYLE="height: 2.21ex; vertical-align: -0.42ex; " SRC="img14.svg"
 ALT="$\ge$"></SPAN>1.8.x) require at least one following extra character). If there are
more methods starting with <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">test</SPAN>, each will be called and for each <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">setup</SPAN>
will be called first.

<P>
In <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">setup</SPAN> we need to prepare everything for the execution of FORM. We can
either use <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">input</SPAN> to in-line the source directly, or we can use
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">input_file</SPAN> with a string as an argument to reference an external file,
e.g.
<PRE>
  input_file "parsebug.frm"
</PRE>
The function <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">input</SPAN> will create a temporary
FORM file for the contents. The name of the file is defined in <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">form.rb</SPAN>.
The executable will later be run with the given name or the name of the
temporary file as an argument. If additional arguments need to be given to the
executable, the function <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">extra_parameter</SPAN> can be used, like e.g.
<PRE>
  extra_parameter "-w4 -l"
</PRE>

<P>
Sometimes one might need to prepare more things for a FORM run, like setting
up certain files or starting an external program. This needs to be done
by ordinary Ruby code. For this, some more of the Ruby language needs to be
known by the user.

<P>
In the class methods with a name starting with <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">test</SPAN> we put the code to run
the FORM executable and to test the outcome. Usually, the first line will be
the call to the executable itself, either
<PRE>
  execute FORM
</PRE>
or
<PRE>
  execute TFORM
</PRE>
(P<SMALL>AR</SMALL>FORM is not supported yet). The function <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">execute</SPAN> will run the
executable with the necessary or requested arguments, but it will run it under
the supervision of the <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">strace</SPAN> system utility. Therefore <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">strace</SPAN> needs to
be present on the system (options to enable or disable the use of <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">strace</SPAN>
will probably be added in the future). <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">strace</SPAN> is used to get detailed
information about the return value or possible failure states of the executable.
The output of <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">strace</SPAN> will be saved in a temporary file and made available to
the test case programmer in a Ruby variable. The regular output and the error
channel output will be available in Ruby variables as well.

<P>
The Ruby variables containing the output are <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">@strace_out</SPAN>, <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">@stdout</SPAN>,
and <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">@stderr</SPAN> (the leading @-sign is Ruby syntax for specifying instance
variables, i.e. variables belonging to a certain object). These variables are the
primary source for doing tests. In principle, these variables can be
investigated directly, for example via pattern matching like
<PRE>
  if @strace_out =~ /Segmentation fault/
    ...
  end
</PRE>
which checks whether a segmentation fault has occurred (the slashes in Ruby
define a pattern). But for the most common cases some test functions
exist that encapsulate necessary pattern matching details. These functions
return true or false values which can be used as arguments to the <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">assert</SPAN>
function. The <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">assert</SPAN> function raises an error if the argument is false.

<P>
Available tests functions are:

</TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
Additionally, the logical opposite of each function exists with a name starting
with <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">no_</SPAN>, like <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">no_problem</SPAN> or <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">no_crash</SPAN>.

<P>
There is also the function <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">return_value</SPAN> which gives the return value of the
FORM program as an integer, so one could do a check like
<PRE>
  assert return_value == 66
</PRE>

<P>
If pattern matching is coded directly, like in our example, some details have to
be considered. The operator <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">=˜</SPAN> will try to match a string with a pattern.
The variables like <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">@stdout</SPAN> are actually strings (they do contain the
carriage return and/or line feed for multi-line output). Patterns in Ruby are
written between slashes and various characters are interpreted in a special way
(following the widely used regex-syntax).

<P>
There are four functions to facilitate things: <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">result()</SPAN>, <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">pattern()</SPAN>,
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">exact_result()</SPAN>, and <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">exact_pattern()</SPAN>. <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">result()</SPAN> takes a string being
the name of an expression and returns a string that only contains the lines
belonging to the last output of this expression. If it is not the last output of
an expression that is wished for, a second numeric parameter can be given that
specifies the index of the output (counting starts at 0).  While <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">result()</SPAN>
removes all line breaks and whitespaces, <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">exact_result()</SPAN> leaves them in
place.  <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">pattern()</SPAN> transforms special characters in the given string, removes
whitespaces and line breaks, and returns the string as a pattern. Since FORM expressions usually contain a lot of special characters like +, *, ., etc. they
cannot not be simply used in a pattern. <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">pattern()</SPAN> transforms these
characters automatically into the correct regex equivalent, e.g. + becomes
\+.  With it, a FORM expression can be directly given as an
argument and used in a pattern matching (see example). <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">exact_pattern()</SPAN> does
not treat whitespaces and line breaks in a special way as <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">pattern()</SPAN> does and
can therefore be used when a exact comparison is required (if for example a bug
in the output functions of FORM had caused some whitespace or line breaks to
be missing and a test case were required to check for this behavior).

<P>
If one doesn't want or cannot use the <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">assert</SPAN> function, one can signal a test
failure to the testing framework by raising an <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">AssertionFailedError</SPAN>
directly, like for example
<PRE>
  if return_value != 2
    raise AssertionFailedError.new("return value is wrong!")
  end
</PRE>

<P>
Suppose a FORM program should have deleted some file (<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">#remove</SPAN>), one could
implement the following test
<PRE>
  if File.exist?("thenameofthefile")
    raise AssertionFailedError.new("File still exists!")
  end
</PRE>

<P>
The testing framework actually not only calls <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">setup</SPAN> and each <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">test</SPAN> method
but also a method called <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">teardown</SPAN>. This method is responsible for cleaning
up things at the end of each test run. The class <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">FormTest</SPAN> provides such a
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">teardown</SPAN> method that will be inherited by the users test case class unless
it is overwritten. It calls the method <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">remove_files</SPAN> to delete all temporary
files that have been created so far. <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">remove_files</SPAN> can be called by the user
directly. If <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">teardown</SPAN> is to be replaced by a specific implementation, it is
advisable to still call <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">FormTest</SPAN>'s <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">teardown</SPAN> (using Ruby's command
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">super</SPAN>), like for example
<PRE>
  ...
  def teardown
    super
    File.delete("extra.log")
  end
  ...

      Fixed 2005-09-27
    =end
    class SparseTable1 &lt; FormTest
    def setup
      input &lt;&lt;-EOF
    cf f;
    s x;
    ctable Tab(1:`TableSize');
    ctable TabNew(1:`TableSize');
    
    #do i=1,`TableSize',1
    Fill Tab(`i')=f(`i');
    .sort
    #enddo
    
    * BUG1 (not all elements are printed):
    PrintTable Tab;
    
    bracket x;
    .sort
    L expr1=table_(Tab,x);
    print;
    .sort
    
    bracket x;
    .sort
    
    * BUG 2 ( seems only TabNew(1) is ok - further everything is broken):
    Fillexpression TabNew=expr1(x);
    .sort
    
    #do i=1,`TableSize'
    L e`i'=TabNew(`i');
    #enddo
    print;
    .sort
    .end
      EOF
      extra_parameter "-D TableSize=10"
    end
    def test1
      execute FORM
      assert no_problem
      assert result("expr1") =~ pattern(&lt;&lt;-EOF

<P>
Some remarks. Folds are used (to structure a long file). <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">=begin</SPAN> and <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">=end</SPAN>
define a commentary block. Here useful information are given about the bug that
triggered the test case. The input is not modified compared to the original
FORM program, it is just directly pasted into this Ruby file. We use
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">extra_parameter</SPAN> to define a preprocessor variable for the run. We check
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">expr1</SPAN> to a multi-line reference. Since we use <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">pattern()</SPAN> (instead of
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">exact_pattern()</SPAN>), we can be sloppy about the indentation and the whitespaces.
The expression <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">e10</SPAN> is matched to a pattern done "by hand" instead (just to
show the principle). For such a test case, where we are mostly interested about
the correctness of the calculation, the first assertion (<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">assert no_problem</SPAN>)
is a standard.

<P>
The CVS repository resides in <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">/user/form/cvs_repository</SPAN>. It is advisable to
set the environment variable <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">CVSROOT</SPAN> accordingly, like (using bash shell syntax)
<SPAN CLASS="SCRIPTSIZE"></SPAN><PRE>
  export CVSROOT=:ext:myusername@mytrustedmachine.nikhef.nl:/user/form/cvs_repository
</PRE><SPAN CLASS="SCRIPTSIZE"></SPAN>

<P>
A mailing list exists for CVS commits. The administration interface for this mailing list can be
found under the web address

<P>
<SPAN style="font-family:monospace">https://mailman.nikhef.nl/cgi-bin/admin/form-cvs</SPAN>

<P>
A password is required. 

<P>
Click <I>Membership Management</I> and then <I>Mass Subscription</I> to add
new people. The personal details of the subscribers like the email address or
the name can be changed under <I>Membership Management</I> as well.

<P>
The triggering of the CVS commits mails is done in the following way. In the
file <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">loginfo</SPAN> in the directory <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">CVSROOT</SPAN> (inside the repository) the
default action for logging is set such that the script <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">/user/form/cvs-log.sh</SPAN>
will be called with the committer's user name and the CVS mailing list user
name. The shell script does some simple message transformation and then uses the
command <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">mail</SPAN> to send the commit mail to the mailing list.

<P>
To just show what would be updated/changed without actually
modifying anything, use
<PRE>
  cvs -n update
</PRE>

<P>
If <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">cvs -n update</SPAN> has shown you that something new in the repository will be
merged into your directory and you want to know in advance what the details are,
you can do for each of the files involved a
<PRE>
  cvs status &lt;filename&gt;
</PRE>
and note the version number of your local file, and then do a
<PRE>
  cvs diff -r &lt;versionnumber&gt; &lt;filename&gt;
</PRE>
to see the differences.

<P>
In case you want to compile an older version of FORM (maybe to find out
whether a certain bug is already present or not), do
<PRE>
  cvs update -D "&lt;DATE&gt;"
</PRE>
to checkout the sources as they were on a certain date, e.g. 
<BR><SPAN style="font-family:monospace">cvs update -D "2006-05-12"</SPAN>. The files will get the so-called sticky flag,
which do prevent simple <SPAN style="font-family:monospace">cvs update</SPAN> commands in the future to update to the
latest version from the repository. To remove the sticky flag on a file use
<PRE>
  cvs update -A &lt;filename&gt;
</PRE>
Without the filename all files will have the sticky flag removed.
